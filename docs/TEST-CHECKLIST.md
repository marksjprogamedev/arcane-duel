# Manual test checklist: Arcane Duel 0.1.3-0 (map groups)

> **INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE AI ASSISTANT (e.g. ChatGPT) READING THIS FILE**
>
> This is a manual test plan for a browser game. The tester (Mark) will paste this file to you.
> Do this:
>
> 1. Walk him through the sections **in order**, one section at a time. Do not skip ahead.
> 2. For each item, tell him exactly what to do and what he should see (the "Expect" text).
> 3. Ask him to answer **PASS**, **FAIL** (plus what he saw) or **SKIP** (plus why) for each item.
> 4. Keep a running tally using the checkboxes below (`[ ]` untested, `[x]` pass, `[!]` fail,
>    `[-]` skipped). Show the updated list whenever he asks "where am I?".
> 5. If an item fails, record the item ID, what he saw, the browser, and whether it repeats on a
>    refresh. Do not try to fix it; continue with the next item, unless a later item depends on it
>    (marked "needs").
> 6. At the end, output a **FAILURE REPORT**: every `[!]` item with its ID, expected vs. actual,
>    and any notes, ready to paste back to Jesse.
>
> Setup he needs: two browser windows (or one normal and one incognito window, or two devices),
> both open at **http://159.13.37.255:8082/**. He is the **host** in one window and the
> **guest** in the other.

## 0. Setup

- [ ] **S1** Open http://159.13.37.255:8082/ in window A and window B. Expect: the menu loads in both.
- [ ] **S2** The version label (top corner and in the menu) reads **v0.1.3-0 · Map groups**. If it
      shows something older, hard-refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R). If still wrong, stop and report: the deploy
      has not finished.
- [ ] **S3** Optional, for a technical check: open http://159.13.37.255:8082/stats in a third tab.
      Expect `"version": "Arcane Duel v0.1.3-0 map groups"` and `"protocolVersion": 6`.

## 1. Menu and solo play (window A only)

- [ ] **M1** The map picker is labelled **MAP** (not "BATTLEGROUND"). Expect: it has one group
      heading **Arenas** with 10 maps, and **no** Battlegrounds group.
- [ ] **M2** Default selection is **Enchanted Arena**.
- [ ] **M3** Change the picker through every map. Expect: the background behind the menu changes
      each time and none is blank or broken.
- [ ] **M4** The small text under the picker says the room creator picks the map online. It does not
      say "Online uses the original arena".
- [ ] **M5** Choose **Dark Wizards' Circle**, press **DUEL AI**. Expect: a table in the middle and
      monuments; walking into them is blocked, and spells hit them.
- [ ] **M6** Choose another map (e.g. Frozen Lake) and start a training mode. Expect: it plays on
      that map (four pillars block movement and shots).
- [ ] **M7** Return to the menu. Expect: the game does not crash and the picker still works.

## 2. Lobby (window A = host, window B = guest)

- [ ] **L1** Window A: **Create Private Room**. Expect: a lobby appears with a 6-letter room code
      and a COPY button.
- [ ] **L2** Press **COPY**. Expect: it either copies (you can paste elsewhere) or the code gets
      selected with a hint to copy it. The site is HTTP, so the fallback is normal.
- [ ] **L3** Window A: **START** is disabled, and the status says to share the code and wait.
- [ ] **L4** Window B: join with the code. Expect: B shows the lobby with the map picker greyed out
      (read-only) and the text "The host chooses the map." A's status says the opponent is here and
      START becomes enabled. **(needs L1)**
- [ ] **L5** The picker in the lobby shows the **Arenas** group with 10 maps. No Battlegrounds group.
- [ ] **L6** Window A changes the map several times. Expect: window B's picker follows each change
      live, within about a second.
- [ ] **L7** Window B tries to change the picker. Expect: it can't (disabled).
- [ ] **L8** No text in the lobby says "the match still uses the original arena".

## 3. Synced map (the main feature of 0.1.2). Needs L4

Do this once with **Dark Wizards' Circle** and once with a second map (e.g. Frozen Lake).

- [ ] **Y1** Host picks **Dark Wizards' Circle** and presses START. Expect: both windows start the
      match at the same time, on the same background, each showing the table and monuments.
- [ ] **Y2** Each player walks into the table and a monument. Expect: blocked in both windows,
      and the other player sees you stopped at the same place (no walking through things on one screen).
- [ ] **Y3** Fire spells at the table and monuments from both sides. Expect: they hit the obstacles
      in both views.
- [ ] **Y4** Spawn positions: you start on the left, the opponent on the right, in both windows
      (mirrored view of the same fight).
- [ ] **Y5** Repeat Y1 to Y4 with **Frozen Lake**. Expect: the four pillars, not the table and
      monuments, on both screens.
- [ ] **Y6** Finish the match (let someone die). Both press rematch. Expect: the **same map** again.
- [ ] **Y7** On the end screen use **BACK TO LOBBY** (either player). Expect: both return to the
      lobby with the previous map still selected.
- [ ] **Y8** In the lobby, host picks a different map and starts. Expect: the new map is used by both.

## 4. Lobby edge cases

- [ ] **E1** Guest leaves while in the lobby (LEAVE ROOM). Expect: the host's lobby stays open, START
      disabled again, status asks for an opponent.
- [ ] **E2** A guest joins again with the same code. Expect: it works.
- [ ] **E3** Host leaves the lobby. Expect: the room closes; the guest is told the peer left and goes
      back to the menu.
- [ ] **E4** Try to join with a wrong code. Expect: a clear error, no crash.
- [ ] **E5** Join a room that is already full (use a third tab). Expect: an error, existing players
      unaffected.

## 5. Reconnect (during a match)

- [ ] **R1** In a running match, turn off the network in one window for about 3 s (browser dev tools
      -> Network -> Offline, or Wi-Fi off), then back on. Expect: the other player sees "Opponent lost
      connection", then both continue on the **same map** with correct collisions.
- [ ] **R2** Stay offline for more than 15 s. Expect: the match ends or the player is told they were
      disconnected; no frozen or broken screen on the other side.

## 6. Outdated client

- [ ] **O1** Leave a tab open from before the update (if one exists). Expect: it tells you to
      refresh the page. Do not worry if you have no old tab.

## 7. Regression: normal play

- [ ] **G1** Movement (WASD / keys) feels smooth online, no rubber-banding on your own wizard.
- [ ] **G2** The opponent moves smoothly, no stutter.
- [ ] **G3** Spells cast, travel and hit as before. Try a few elements and a charged spell.
- [ ] **G4** Bombs, traps and the reflective bubble work.
- [ ] **G5** The HUD (health, cooldowns) updates correctly.
- [ ] **G6** The end screen shows the right winner on both sides.

## 8. Server health (optional, technical)

While a match is running, open http://159.13.37.255:8082/stats.

- [ ] **H1** `matchesRunning` is 1, `playersAway` is 0.
- [ ] **H2** `lastSecond.ticks` is about 60.
- [ ] **H3** `lastSecond.tickMsMax` is well below 16 (a good result is under 2).
- [ ] **H4** `memoryMb` is not climbing past roughly 100 over a few minutes.

Reference reading from Jesse's own session: ticks 60, tickMsAvg 0.124, tickMsMax 0.288, bytesOut
~46 KB/s, memory 73 MB. Similar numbers are good.
